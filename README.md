# WordFinder

### Using Python to solve a 10 x 10 word search

The program accepts the puzzle as a string of letters and words to search for. 

When all words are handled, the program outputs the puzzle in 10 x 10 format (as opposed to the single input string) and displays each target word along with its direction and the row/column where it was found. 
If a word was not found, the program will say so. 

Note: the program cannot handle words that are hidden diagonally.
